# SocialBook


This is a project from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSUm6iMtREA.
Using this project to impove my python and git skills


So, the project has come to an end.

What I managed to do:

-better understand how Django works
-better understanding of Git and its conflicts

What is this project? It's a very basic copy a social media site ( eg. Instagram).
You can:
-create and customize your profile;
-upload photos;
-follow other users, like and even download their posts;
-search them and get them suggested
