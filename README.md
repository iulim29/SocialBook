This is a project from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSUm6iMtREA.
Using this project to impove my python and git skills


So, the project has come to an end.

What I managed to do:

-better understanding of how Django works /n
-better understandinging of Git and its conflicts /n

What is this project? It's a very basic copy a social media site ( eg. Instagram).
You can:/n
-create and customize your profile;/n
-upload photos;/n
-follow other users, like and even download their posts;/n
-search them and get them suggested
